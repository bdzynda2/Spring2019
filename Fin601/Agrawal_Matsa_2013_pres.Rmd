## Introduction


### Unemployment Risk

- Workers face adverse consequences from unemployment
- Workers require a higher premium to take on more unemployment risk
- Firms can factor in this cost and manage it
- Hard to measure
- Hard to disentangle from other financial policy considerations

## Introduction
### Background Theory

- Workers facing unemployment risk require higher wages, additional benefits, improved working conditions 
- Firms must compensate ex ante for workers to bear these risks
- Compensation increases with risks

## Introduction
### Background Theory

- Compensation demanded by workers facing unemployment risk should affect firms' financing policy
- More debt gives greater probability of financial distress
- Higher financial distress expands worker's exposure to unemployment risk
- Then, raising leverage will raise worker's "premium"

_NPV[Debt Issue] = NPV[Tax Shield] + NPV[Cost of Financial Distress] + $\Delta$ Labor Expense_

## Introduction

### Contribution and Hypothesis
- Because of labor frictions, the cost of debt becomes higher. _Because debt financing increases the probability of layoffs in distress, it raises the compensation that workers require today to bear increased unemployment risk_. \
- Provides novel empirical evidence that worker unemployment risk significantly impacts firms' corporate financial policies





## Contribution and Hypothesis



### __Hypothesis:__ 
Firms choose conservative financial policies partly as a means of mitigating worker exposure to unemployment risk


## Design

- Overcome challenge of measuring unemployment risk by exploiting changes in unemployment laws
- More generous state unemployment benefits make layoffs less costly and reduce workers' demand for compensation

###Prediction
_Increasing generosity of state unemployment benefits lead to higher firm leverage and lower interest coverage ratios_

## Design
### Unemployment Benefits

- Use state unemployment benfits to identify impact of shock to unemployment risk on financial policy
- Must assume that residual variation of UI benefits, after sufficient controls, is uncorrelated with unobservable covariates affecting corporate leverage.


## Design
### Tests

(1) Show relation between UI generosity and leverage is strong for firms whose workers face greater expected unemployment costs
(2) Show relation between UI generosity and firms with tight financing
(3) Examine timing of leverage changes to pin a causal link
(4) Look at bordering states to test economic conditions
(5) Look at other mechanisms: firm UI cost and unions




## Institutional Background

- Each state has autonomy in UI benefits
    - Can select eligibility, wage benefit amounts, duration
- Variation stems largely from maximum bounds and duration
- Economic conditions also contribute to variation
- Political forces also contribute
- Managers may be more willing to layoff worers in times of generous UI


## Institutional Background
### Meaningful Shock

Then, changes in unemployment benefits make for a meaningful shock to the cost of layoff of workers. Heterogeneity across states helps. Additionally, variation in unemployment insurance laws helps to make a clean setting to look at relation between financial policy and workers exposure to risk. 



## Data 

![](am13_1.PNG)


## Data

- Collect data on state UI benefit laws and firm balance sheet characterisitcs
- UI benefits from Dept of Labor 1950 - 2008
- Generosity is measured as maximum benefit amount and duration alllowed

## Data

- Variation between max benefits is high (\$6000 in MS to \$28,000 in MA)
- At some point all states experience changes in state UI benefits over sample period
- States typically increase benefits from 25% to 75%
- No indication that states change laws affecting corporate debt capacity with UI laws
- Correlation between tax rate and log max total benefit is not significant. 


## Data

- Compustat
- All firms (except financial and utilities) from 1950 -2008
- Non-missing Observations
- 14,000 firms and 140,000 firm years
- Winsorized at 1% tails

## Method

- Use a Panel Regression

$$\frac{DEBT_{ist}}{VALUE_{ist}} = \alpha_1LN(MAX\_UI\_BENEFIT)_{st-1}+X_{ist}\beta + \nu_i + \omega_t + \varepsilon_{ist}$$

where $i$ is firm in state $s$ at time $t$. 

### Variables

- $X_{it}$ is set of controls
- $\nu_i$ is firm fixed effects
- $\omega_t$ is year fixed effects

Controls include proportion of fixed assets, M/B ratio, log of sales, probability of banktrupcy, ROA, state unemployment rate, state GDP. 

- Standard errors corrected for clustering at state level

## Results

- 100 log point increase in total benefits result in 4.5% greater average market leverage (1) 
- Accounting for firms whose headquarters and high percentage of workers are in different states gives $\alpha = 5.7$ (3) 
- Still significant controlling for firm characteristics and macroeconomic conditions (4) and (2) 
- Significant across first differences (5) 
- Significant when excluding outlier observation

## Results

## Results

- Panel B shows book leverage, which have consistent results across the models with market leverage. They are slightly less, suggesting firms actively optimize. 

- Panel C employes interest coverage (ratio of operating earnings before depreciation to interest expense) which measure a firm's ability to use currect profits to cover interest payments of debt. 
    - Helps capture debt use of growing firms
    - Higher UI benefits imply lower interest coverage ratios (more debt)
- 100 log point increase in max UI benefit suggest 15% lower interest coverage. 



## Identification Analysis

### (1) Control for local macroeconomic conditions

Have minimal effect on estimated association between UI benefits and leverage (in columns 2-6 of Table 3)



## Identification Analysis

### (2) Timing

If poor, unobserved economic conditions cause firms to increase leverage and induce legislators to raise UI benefits, one should expect to see increases in leverage before benefits improve.

- Table 4 shows inclusion of controls for contemporaneous and forward values of UI benefits in leverage regressions does not affect correlation beween lagged UI benefits and corporate leverage ratio

## Identification Analysis

### (3) Heterogeneities

(1) Would expect to find stronger relation between UI benefits and corporate financial policies in industries where labor unemployment risk is more relevant

(2) Relation between UI generosity and firms' financial policies should be stronger for financially constrained firms - financing frictions increase unemployment risk and means for higher wage premiums demanded. Conservative financing should ensue. 


## Heterogeneities - Greater Unemployment Risk

## Identification Analysis

### (4) Local Unobservable Economic Shocks

- Separate firms who have higher intrastate commerce
- Firms with higher out of state sales have greater relationship between UI generosity and leverage


## Identification Analysis

## Identification Analysis

### (5) Profits

Max UI benefits does not significantly affect profits (ROA)

![](am13_8.PNG)



## Identification Analysis

### (6) Neighboring states

If firm's operations are concentrated at firm HQ, generosity of UI in neighboring states should bear no effect


## Neighboring states

## Alternative Mechanisms

### Pure Cash Flow Effect
- When UI benefits increase, firms' premium costs increase. Less money to pay debt, then, and leverage is increases
- Rejected by data (from identification analysis looking at profitability)

### Strategic Leverage
- Greater UI benefits could lead to wage bargaining. Firms could raise leverage to maintain tougher bargining stance. 
- Repeat analysis separating firms based on high and low union presence. 
- Relation between UI benefits and leverage are not significantly different between groupings




## Estimating Indirect Costs of Financial Distress

Want to measure full impact of unemployment risk on firm's financial decisions

### Employment Changes around Default

- Develop numerical estimates for present value of excess labor costs associated with leverage choices
- Use default probabilities for each credit rating
- Calculate labor cost required to compensate workers for expect loss if firm defaults
- Need unemployment risk associated with financial distress - gather employment change data

## Estimating Indirect Costs of Financial Distress

### Costs and Benefits of Leverage

- Use wage premium per dollar of assets
    - Function of probability of default times per unit wage premium and labor expense divided by market value of assets and the sum of return on debt plus probability of default
    
- $\omega / A = (pv\Pi L/ A)/(r_d+p)$

## Summary and Conclusion

- Reductions in labor unemployment risk are associated with increases in corporate leverage 
    - Exploit variation in unemployment insureance benefit levels
- Average wage compensation for unemployment risk totals 60 basis points
- Companies choose conservative financial policy to mitigate worker's exposure to unemployment risks
    - Reducing leverage decreases probability that firm will encounter financial distress
- Labor market frictions matter for corporate environment
