## Introduction

### Key Points

- Paper documents evidence for behavioral biases among Chicago Board of Trade
- Traders in this market are highly loss-averse, assume above average risk to combat earlier losses
- This behavior has important price impact on afternoon prices
- Prices set by loss-averse traders are reversed significantly more quickly than by unbiased traders




## Introduction


### Overview

Testing for behavior biases is hard

  - Many different behavioral theories rooted in Psychology
  - Models cannot be easily tested with aggregate data
      - Detailed data is hard to get
  - Hard to measure investor horizon 
  - Hard to distinguish from noise trading
      - Challenging to link bias impact on prices
      

## Introduction

### Setting - Chicago Board of Traders 

- Bias should show up:
    - Traders exchange $200 million worth of contracts per day
    - Traders participate in 95% of all trades
- Trades are done by market makers - with personal accounts
- Trading Horizon is clear - most traders close position every day



## Introduction

### Roadmap

(1) Look for signs of traders taking either greater or lesser risk as profits grow
(2) Split trading day and compare trading in morning and evening
(3) Examine traders to see if they are more likely to move afternoon prices following morning losses
(4) Examine permanence of price moves spurred by morning losses
(5) Examine whether prices exhibit greater volatility in afternoons following morning losses




## Introduction

### Bias in Beliefs

(1) Self-Attribution (overconfidence)
(2) Conservativeness and Representativeness 


### Bias in Preferences

(1) Prospect Theory
    - Profits near zero lead to high subsequent risk aversion
    - Risk-seeking behavior present in region of losses
(2) House-money Effect


## Prospect Theory

## Prospect vs VN-M Utility

![](pres_pics/cs05_01.PNG)\


## Hypothesis and Assumptions

__Hypothesis__: There is no relationship between morning returns and afternoon risk-taking

### Assumptions

(1) Efficient Markets
(2) Rational Traders
(3) Traders have Von Neumann-Morgenstern utility functions
(4) Negligible Wealth Effects
(5) Margin constraints unimportant
(6) Traders' compensation and reputation concerns neutral
(7) Profit opportunities are uncorrelated across trading day



## Hypothesis

### Alternative 1

Self-attribution bias, representativeness heuristic, and house money effect predict morning returns will be positively related to afternoon risk-taking


### Alternative 2

Risk-seeking in losses predicts the null will be rejected if morning returns are negatively related to afternoon risk-taking






## Data 


- CBOT T-Bond futures 1998
    - Includes identifiers for buyer and seller, price, time of transaction, and on whose behalf
- 426 Traders using their own personal account. 
- To measure profit and inventory, assume each trader closes position at end of day (no beginning inventory)
    - Use inventory controls and winsorize
- Profit computed by looking at market value of inventory times contracts outstanding, added to local's running profit figure


## Data

### Measuring Risk 

- Use historical price change data, second-by-second time and sales from Future Industry Institute Data Center
- Calculate front-month futures contract prices at the beginning of each minute from 1989 to 1998
- Fit Ordered Logit Regression to get probability of various potential abs price changes over next minute



## Data

### Measuring Risk 


- Use fitted values to construct an expected absolute price change for each minute of each full trading day in 1998. 
- Calculate trader's risk by multiplying each minute's risk measure by the trader's position at the beginning of the minute. 
- Adjust trader's risk for the minute by any changes in inventory (and therefore risk) in the minute 
- Calculate cumulative risk - Total Dollar Risk



## Method


- Split trading day into two periods: before 11:00 am and after
- For each trader, calculate morning and evening profits
- Also, calculate total dollar risk, number of trades and average trade size
- Normalize traders profits and risk-taking to account for heterogeneity in margin constraints

## Morning Losses Lead to Afternoon Risk-Taking

Regress Afternoon risk-taking on morning profits:

![](pres_pics/cs05_2.PNG)\

where 

- $\pi^M_{i,t}$ is trader _i_'s date _t_ morning profit
- $\big| INV^M_{i,t} \big |$ is abs value of trader _i_'s outstanding position at the end of the morning on date $t$. 
- $RISK_{i,t}^M$ is trader $i$'s morning risk measured on date $t$

They also used Pooled Regression and Fama-MacBeth

## Results 

- A one standard deviation decrease in morning profits leads the average trader to to place more afternoon trades than normal
- Higher inventory positions midday associated with higher afternoon risk
- Traders who assume significant risk in the morning continue to do so in afternoon
- Consistent results when top N% of traders with morning losses compared to only top N% of traders with greatest morning gains

## Semiparametric Regression

Use semi-parametric model to account for kinks:

![](pres_pics/cs05_9.PNG)\



## Setup

![](pres_pics/cs05_10.PNG)\


Steps:

- Rank traders each day according to their normalized morning profit and assign them to one of 20 profitability groups
- Conduct daily cross-sectional regressions with model above
- Dummy variable $D$ equals one if trader $i$'s morning profit ranks in group $j$ on the date $t$. 
- Average the cross-sectional regression coefficients across time, compute standard errors


## Semiparametric Regression

Losing trader behavior is more sensitive to the level of their losses than winning traders to the level of their gains!



## Time until Midday Position Unwound

Traders who lose money in morning assume greater risk in afternoon. Now, want to see the time traders take to unwind their midday inventory using a hazard model. 

![](pres_pics/cs05_12.PNG)\


Where $h_0(\tau)$ is baseline hazard function, $\tau$ measures time since 11am, $(P^M_t - \bar P^I_{i,t})$ measures the futures contract price at 11am less the contract weighted average price at which trader $i$ acquired his inventory on day $t$. 

- Interested in coefficient $\beta_V$ which measures the speed at which positions are unwound. 





## Time until Midday Position Unwound


![](pres_pics/cs05_13.PNG)\









## Price Impact 

- Identify local trades that cause the posted price to change from bid to ask because of purchase or sale of local trader for own account
- If local purchases at a price higher than previous price, identify the trade as responsible for having raised the price. Similar with selling. 
- With price moving trades, can see if more occur following winning vs losing mornings
- Use following Regression:


![](pres_pics/cs05_14.PNG)\



## Price Impact

- Traders with losses in the morning are much more dramatically reversed than those set by traders with gains in the morning. 
- On average the trader with morning losses places 25% more price-setting trades than an equivalent trader with morning gains.
- Reversals are 27% larger for traders with morning losses than that of other trader
- Suggests loss aversion is important factor
- Tick by tick testing shows reversals happen quickly







## Price Volatility 



### Question: 

Do price-setting trades executed by locals with morning losses cause afternoon prices to be more volatile?

### Claim

- Loss aversion may lead to greater afternoon risk seeking and increased placement of price-moving trades 
    - afternoon volatility increases following mornings with widespread losses
- Or could lead to increased reversal in prices set by traders attempting to make up morning losses
    - Should see only little increase in afternoon volatility
    




## Price Volatility 

### Measurement

standard deviation of price changes measured at 1-second, 1-minute, 5-minutes, 10-minute and half-day frequency. 


### Regression

Normalize normalize afternoon volatility on the volatility in the corresponding morning

$$\sigma_{h,t}^A = \alpha + \beta_{\sigma} \sigma_{h,t}^M + \beta_\lambda \lambda_t^M + \varepsilon _t$$

- $\sigma^A$ measures abnormal volatility of afternoon price changes for frequency $h$. 
- $\lambda^M$ measures aggregate morning losses on day $t$. 


## Price Volatility 

### Results - Volatility

- Afternoon price volatility is related to morning market maker profitability
- Traders with morning losses place additional price-setting afternoon trades to assume additional risk
- Lose results after 10 minute interval
- Traders with morning losses create only short-term afternoon deviations from fundamentals

## Conclusion

- Paper claims to offer unique setting to test behavioral theory 
- Traders appear loss averse
- Assume more risk following morning losses
- Price impact is not long lasting for these traders


### Other Thoughts

- One year of data - Could this be learned by traders and corrected?
- Do we see cyclical ebbs and flows of biases?
